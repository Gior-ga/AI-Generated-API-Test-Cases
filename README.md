# AI-Generated API Test Cases

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **AI to automatically generate API test cases** based on endpoint descriptions and specifications.

The goal is to reduce manual testing effort and improve test coverage by leveraging AI-assisted test generation.

## Features
- AI-generated test cases for REST APIs
- Covers:
  - Valid requests
  - Invalid inputs
  - Edge cases
- Structured test output format
- Human-readable test descriptions

## Example Use Cases
- Rapid API testing
- Improving QA workflows
- Supporting backend development

## Implementation
AI is used to analyze API endpoint descriptions and generate test scenarios, including input data and expected outcomes.

## Future Improvements
- Faster test generation workflows
- Automated execution of generated tests
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

## Technologies
- AI-assisted text generation
- REST API concepts
- Software testing fundamentals
